<strong>Dear %value[first_name_adviser] %value[last_name_adviser]</strong>,<br/>
   <p>Your advisee, %value[first_name] %value[last_name], has submitted a Full-Time/Half-Time Equivalency form which requires your approval. To approve this request, please reply to this email. If you do not approve, please contact the student directly.</p>
<p>Students may be certified as having full-time or half-time equivalency for an academic term under certain conditions (please see the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/equivalency.html">Gallatin website</a> for more information).  Because equivalency may impact a student's eligibility for certain kinds of financial aid, we ask you to submit your approval by replying to this email as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
If you have questions about the M.A. program requirements, please feel free to contact the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-advising.html">M.A. program directors</a>.
