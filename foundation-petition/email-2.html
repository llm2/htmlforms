<strong>Dear %value[first_name] %value[last_name]</strong>,<br/>
   <p>We have received your Foundation Requirement Petition. Please be aware that if you have not attached a syllabus for the requested course, it will not be possible to review your petition. 
Please note the following:
•         Submission of this form does not guarantee approval of your request.
•         The review of this course may take up to six weeks, depending on the time of submission during the academic year.  If you are requesting a review of a course you are planning to take in a near-future semester, you should arrange to take an alternate course while this review is in progress.
•         Courses taken as Pass/Fail cannot be used to satisfy the foundation requirement.
•         To fulfill the historical and cultural requirements, students must complete three unique courses.  The same course cannot be used to fulfill more than one area.


</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:advising.gallatin@nyu.edu">advising.gallatin@nyu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Best,<br />
