<strong>Dear Adviser,</strong>
<p>Your advisee, %value[first_name] %value[last_name], has submitted a Plan of Study which requires your approval before we can clear the student to register for classes on Albert.  All students have been instructed to speak with their advisers about their course selections prior to submitting the Plan of Study form.  If your advisee has not discussed this Plan of Study with you, you may reject it, and request that s/he meet with you before resubmitting another Plan of Study.</p> 

<p>Before approving your student’s plan, please be mindful of the following restrictions, and help your advisee find an alternative course if he or she selects a restricted course.  The student’s class adviser might also help with this.<p/>
