<strong>Dear Adviser</strong>,<br/>
   <p>Your advisee, %value[first_name] %value[last_name], has submitted a request to receive credit for the Advanced Placement tests as indicated below. The student has been
instructed to only submit this form after first discussing with you the plan to add additional credits to his or her program, thus accelerating progress toward graduation.
</p>

<p>Please reply to this email with your approval if you have had this discussion and you support the student's plan. Please send a reply of disapproval if you do not think your advisee should add AP credit to his or her Gallatin program and accelerate the timeline toward graduation.
</p>

<p>Gallatin asks advisers to approve AP credit requests in order to ensure that the student has discussed with you his or her plan for graduation. Please note that you are not expected to evaluate the AP credits themselves or to determine whether NYU will accept them. Gallatin's Office
of Advising will work with the University to determine if the credit can be transferred.
</p>

<p>If you have any questions about how to advise your student in this matter,
please do not hesitate to contact Gallatin's Office of Advising at <a href="mailto:advising.gallatin@nyu.edu">advising.gallatin@nyu.edu</a>.

<p>Best,<br />
