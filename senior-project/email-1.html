<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name]</strong>,<br/>

<p>This is to confirm that your Senior Project
proposal form is being forwarded to your mentor (and adviser if s/he is not
your mentor) to the email(s) you listed on the proposal form for review and
approval. If
you did not discuss this project with your adviser and/or mentor prior to
submitting this form, your proposal may not be approved. Because you must take additional action before your senior
project proposal can be approved, please read this entire message to make sure
your proposal is not denied.
<p >Your
completed proposal, which includes all of the following, is due at
Gallatin by the <a
href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/calendars/individualized_project_deadlines.html">published proposal submission deadline</a>:  
<ul>
<li>adviser&#8217;s approval</li>
<li>       
mentor&#8217;s approval</li>
<li>        
description of
the project</li>
<li>       
annotated
bibliography or related works</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Proposals missing any of the required items
listed above by the deadline will not be considered for review for this semester.</p>

<h1>Take these steps next</h1>
<ol>
<li>Follow up with your adviser and mentor <em>before
the proposal submission deadline</em> to make sure they have received your
proposal form and have sent their approval to Gallatin.</li>
<li><em>Be informed about the review process</em>.
Your submitted proposal form has also been sent to Gallatin.  We will review the form now to make sure the
description and annotated bibliography or related works are included.  We will also be receiving your adviser&#8217;s and mentor&#8217;s
approval.  When all elements of the full
proposal are received, the Gallatin Senior Project Committee will review the
proposal, provided everything is received by the <a
href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/calendars/individualized_project_deadlines.html">submission deadline</a>.</li>
<li><em>Watch for an email from Gallatin.</em> You might be asked to provide additional
materials, or you might be receiving an approval email with codes to register
on Albert.  The Senior Project Committee
plans to review and respond to all students approximately two weeks after the
<a
href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/calendars/individualized_project_deadlines.html">submission deadline</a>.  </li>
<li>If your proposal is approved and you
receive registration codes, log on to Albert to register for your independent
study. </li>
<li>Be prepared to take an alternate course in
case your proposal is not approved.</li>

<p>If you have any questions about this process,
please contact KatheAnn Joseph (<a href="mailto:katheann.joseph@nyu.edu">katheann.joseph@nyu.edu</a>) at Gallatin.</p>
<p >Sincerely,<br/>
Gallatin Senior Project Committee
