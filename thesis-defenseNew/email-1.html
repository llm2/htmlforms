<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name]</strong>,<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Gallatin M. A. Program has received your Thesis Defense Registration form. We have contacted your adviser to confirm his or her approval for the defense.
</p>
<p>
Please note that Gallatin will only be able to schedule the defense after we have received adviser approval of your thesis. 
</p>
<p>
If you have not already submitted your thesis to Gallatin, please do so using the online <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/utilities/forms/thesis.html">Thesis Submission</a> form. 
</p>
<p>
Once your adviser has approved both your thesis and the defense registration, we will assign a room for your defense. The approval verification and room reservation process can take up to two weeks. We will then e-mail the confirmation of the date, time, and location to you and your committee.  </p>
<p>
After your defense, you are required to incorporate revisions requested by the committee and submit the adviser approved final version within 30 days of your defense using the online <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/utilities/forms/thesis-final.html">Thesis Submission, Final </a>form.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, please write to <a href="mailto:gallatin.thesis@nyu.edu">gallatin.thesis@nyu.edu</a> or call 212-992-6315.<br/><br/><br/>
