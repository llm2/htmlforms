<p><strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name]</strong>,</p>
<p>
This is to confirm that your Polytechnic Institute of NYU Registration form has been submitted to Gallatinâ€™s Office of Student Services.  We will now work with the staff at Poly and the Office of the Registrar to enroll you in the course.
</p><p>
If you were required to obtain permission from the professor of the course, please be aware that you will not be permitted to enroll until Poly has received a copy of that permission.  Please forward emails or letters of permissions from professors to <a href="mailto:studentservices.gallatin@nyu.edu">studentservices.gallatin@nyu.edu</a>. 
</p><p>
Once you have been cleared for enrollment and registered at Poly, you will receive confirmation from the Office of the Registrar, along with instructions on accessing your records at Poly.  It may take up to two weeks before you receive this confirmation.
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
Best Regards,<br/>
NYU Gallatin Office of Student Services<br/>
