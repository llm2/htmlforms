<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name]</strong>
</p>

<p>
This is to confirm that your Internship Proposal is being forwarded to your adviser,  [submission:values:first_name_adviser]  [submission:values:last_name_adviser] ([submission:values:adviser_email]), for review and approval. If you did not discuss this project with them prior to submitting this form, your proposal may not be approved. Because you must take additional action before your internship can be approved, please read this entire message to make sure your proposal is not denied.
</p>
<p>
Your completed proposal, which includes all of the following, is due at Gallatin by the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/calendars/individualized_project_deadlines.html">published proposal submission deadline</a>:  
<ul><li>adviser’s approval</li>
<li>description of the internship</li>
<li>student's learning goals</li></ul>
Proposals missing any of the required items listed above by the deadline will not be considered for review for this semester.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Take these next steps</h2>
<ol><li> <em>Follow up with your adviser before the proposal submission deadline</em> to make sure he or she has received your proposal form and sent approval to Gallatin.</li>
<li>  <em>Be informed about the review process.</em> Your submitted proposal form has also been sent to Gallatin.  We will review the form now to make sure the description and goals are included.  We will also be receiving your adviser’s approval.  When all elements of the full proposal are received, the proposal will be reviewed, provided everything is received by the submission deadline.</li>
<li> <em>Watch for an email from Gallatin.</em>  You might be asked to provide additional materials, or you might be receiving an approval email with codes to register on Albert. </li>
<li> If your proposal is approved and you receive registration codes, log on to Albert to register for your internship. </li>
<li>  Be prepared to take an alternate course in case your proposal is not approved.</li>
</ol>
