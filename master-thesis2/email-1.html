<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name]</strong>,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for submitting the Master’s Thesis II Registration form. Please see the information below for more details about course registration and format.
</p>
<h1>Registration for Master’s Thesis II</h1>
<p>
Gallatin will send an email to your adviser to confirm his/her approval of your plans to register for Master’s Thesis II. Once we receive adviser approval, Gallatin Student Services will send you the codes that you need to register. Please note that it is your responsibility to follow up with your adviser about approving your registration.
</p>
<p>
There are two components to this course: a seminar/workshop that meets four times during the course of the semester and an independent study section with hours to be arranged between the student and faculty adviser. Students will need a permission number (provided by Gallatin) in order to register for their independent study section. To register for the seminar/workshop, you must first enroll in one of the independent study sections (using a permission number), and you will be automatically prompted to select one of the workshop sections. Students may choose from two workshop sections (meeting on different days and times).
</p>
<h1>Course Goals and Format</h1>
<p>
In Master’s Thesis II, you will continue the writing of the thesis with the goal of defending the thesis at the end of the semester. The course will entail independent work and mandatory participation in collaborative and group work.  During the semester when you are enrolled in Master’s Thesis II, you will:
<ul>
<li> meet with your adviser  at least four times to consult about progress on the thesis and receive feedback on drafts;
</li>
<li>attend four sessions organized and led by Gallatin MA program writing staff;</li>
<li>complete the final draft of the thesis under the supervision of  your faculty adviser; and</li>
<li>defend the thesis by an established deadline late in the semester.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Please make note of the dates, times, and location for your workshop section. You should also contact your adviser to arrange a meeting schedule for the semester. See the information about <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum/core-courses-new/MastersThesisII.html">Master’s Thesis II</a> on the Gallatin website for a suggested meeting schedule.

</p>
<p>
Master’s Thesis II is graded pass/fail. To pass this course, you must successfully defend the thesis. If you do not defend the thesis by the deadline, you  will receive an incomplete grade, which will be changed to a passing grade after you defend the thesis. Students who need additional time to complete the thesis must  register for Thesis Advisement in subsequent semesters.
</p>
<h1>Thesis Defense</h1>
<p>
In order to meet the thesis submission and defense deadlines, you must submit the thesis to your adviser no less than ten weeks before the anticipated defense date. This gives your adviser time to review the thesis and suggest final revisions before you submit the thesis to Gallatin and to the other members of the committee, no less than four weeks before the defense deadline. The schedule of work for Master’s Thesis II is designed with these deadlines in mind.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions about Master’s Thesis I, please contact the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-advising.html">M.A. program directors</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely, <br/>
Gallatin M.A. Program
