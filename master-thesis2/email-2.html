<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name_adviser] [submission:values:last_name_adviser]</strong>,
</p>
   <p>Your advisee, [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name], has requested permission to register for Master’s Thesis II, a required Gallatin core course that combines independent work on the thesis (supervised by the adviser) and participation in a series of workshops organized by Gallatin to help support the process.
</p>
   <p>
<strong>Please reply to this email to approve the student’s request to register with the understanding that it commits you to supervise the equivalent of a two credit independent study (the course requirements are outlined below).</strong>
</p>
<p>
Please note that, in addition to the independent study, students must sign up for a writing workshop that meets four times during the course of the semester. While dates are listed for these workshops, actual class meeting times will be flexibly arranged with students after the first two dates. To register for that, students must first enroll in one of the independent study sections (using a permission number provided by Gallatin), and then they are automatically prompted to select one of the workshop sections.
</p>

<h1>Course Goals and Format</h1>
   <p>
In <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum/core-courses-new/MastersThesisII.html">Master’s Thesis II</a>, students will continue the writing of the thesis with the goal of defending the thesis at the end of the semester. The course will entail independent work and mandatory participation in collaborative and group work.  While enrolled in Master’s Thesis II, students:
<ul>
<li>meet with their advisers at least four times to consult about progress on the thesis and receive feedback on drafts;</li>
<li>attend four sessions organized and led by Gallatin MA program writing staff;</li>
<li>complete the final draft of the thesis under the supervision of the faculty adviser; and</li>
<li>defend the thesis by an established deadline late in the semester.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Your advisee should contact you to arrange a meeting schedule for the semester. While Gallatin requires at least four meetings, you may also opt to schedule additional meetings with the student as needed. See the information about Master’s Thesis II on the Gallatin website for a suggested meeting schedule. Students should also make note of the location and times for the required workshops (see the course description for more details).
</p>
   <p>
To pass this course, students must successfully defend the thesis. Students who do not defend the thesis by the deadline will receive an incomplete grade, which will be changed to a passing grade after the student defends the thesis. Students who need additional time to complete the thesis will register for Thesis Advisement in subsequent semesters.
</p>
   <p>
Please note that you will receive compensation for a two-credit independent study for supervising the student’s work in this course.
</p>
<h1>Thesis Defense</h1>
   <p>


Students enrolled in Master’s Thesis II will schedule at least four meetings with their adviser. In order to meet the thesis submission and defense deadlines, students must submit the thesis to the adviser no less than ten weeks before the anticipated defense date. This gives the adviser time to review the thesis and suggest final revisions before the student submits the thesis to Gallatin and to the other members of the committee, no less than four weeks before the defense deadline. The schedule of work for Master’s Thesis II is designed with these deadlines in mind.
