<strong>Dear %value[first_name] %value[last_name]</strong>,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for submitting the Master’s Thesis I Registration form.  Please see the information below for more details about course registration and format.
</p>
<h1>Registration for Master’s Thesis I</h1>
<p>
Gallatin will send an email to your adviser to confirm his/her approval of your plans to register for Master’s Thesis I.  Once we receive adviser approval, Gallatin Student Services will send you the codes that you need to register.  Please note that it is your responsibility to follow up with your adviser about approving your registration. 
</p>
<p>
There are two components to this course: a seminar/workshop that meets four times during the course of the semester and an independent study section with hours to be arranged between the student and faculty adviser. Students will need a permission number (provided by Gallatin) in order to register for their independent study section. To register for the seminar/workshop, you must first enroll in one of the independent study sections (using a permission number), and you will be automatically prompted to select one of the workshop sections. Students may choose from two workshop sections (meeting on different days and times).
</p>
<h1>Course Goals and Format</h1>
<p>
In Master’s Thesis I, you will complete the basic research for and begin drafting the thesis. The course will entail independent work and mandatory participation in collaborative and group work.  During the semester when you are enrolled in Master’s Thesis I, you will:
<ul>
<li> immerse yourself in the relevant scholarly discourses and literatures and begin drafting the 
thesis; </li>
<li>meet with your adviser at least four times to consult on the content, logic, organization and 
methods for the thesis; </li>
<li>attend four workshop sessions organized and led by Gallatin M.A. program writing staff; • at the end of the semester, present your work in progress by participating in a conference organized by Gallatin. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Please make note of the dates, times, and location for your workshop section. You should also contact your adviser to arrange a meeting schedule for the semester. See the information about <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum/core-courses-new/MastersThesisI.html">Master’s Thesis I</a>  on the Gallatin website for a suggested meeting schedule.
</p>
<p>
Master’s Thesis I is graded pass/fail. To pass this course, you must attend the required workshops, fulfill 
the presentation requirement, and demonstrate significant progress toward completing the thesis. 
</p>
<h1>Thesis Proposal Submission and Approval</h1>
<p>
If you do not yet have an approved thesis proposal, you should submit your proposal to Gallatin using 
the online <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/utilities/forms/thesis-proposal.html">Thesis Proposal Submission form</a> as soon as possible. Gallatin strongly recommends 
that students submit the adviser-approved thesis proposal to Gallatin while they are enrolled in Thesis 
Proposal Seminar (the prerequisite to Master’s Thesis I). Students who begin Master’s Thesis I without 
an approved proposal should plan to submit the proposal to Gallatin within the first few weeks of the 
semester. Note that students who complete Thesis Proposal Seminar in the Spring are required to 
submit the thesis proposal to Gallatin by October 1, and students who complete Thesis Proposal 
Seminar in the Fall are required to submit the thesis proposal by February 1. 
If you have questions about Master’s Thesis I, please contact the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-advising.html">M.A. program directors</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely, <br/>
Gallatin M.A. Program
