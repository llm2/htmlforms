<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name_adviser] [submission:values:last_name_adviser]</strong>,
</p>
   <p>Your advisee, [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name], has requested permission to register for Master’s Thesis I, a required Gallatin core course that combines independent work on the thesis (supervised by the adviser) and participation in a series of workshops organized by Gallatin. </p>

<p> <strong> Please reply to this email to approve the student’s request to register with the understanding that it commits you to supervise the equivalent of a two credit independent study (the course requirements are outlined below). </strong>
</p>
   <p>
Please note that, in addition to the independent study, students must sign up for a writing workshop  that meets four times during the course of the semester. To register for that, students must first enroll in one of the independent study sections (using a permission number provided by Gallatin), and then they are automatically prompted to select one of the workshop sections. 
</p>
<h1>Course Goals and Format</h1>
   <p>
In <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum/core-courses-new/MastersThesisI.html">Master’s Thesis I</a>, students will complete the basic research for the thesis and begin to draft it. The course will entail independent work and mandatory participation in collaborative and group work.  While enrolled in Master’s Thesis I, students:
<ul>
<li>
immerse themselves in the relevant scholarly discourses and literatures and begin drafting the 
thesis; </li>
<li>meet with their adviser at least four times to consult on the content, logic, organization and 
methods for the thesis; </li>
<li>attend four workshop sessions organized and led by Gallatin M.A. program writing staff; </li>
</ul>
</p>
   <p>
Your advisee should contact you to arrange a meeting schedule for the semester. While Gallatin strongly suggests at least four meetings, you may also opt to schedule additional meetings with the student as needed. See the information about Master’s Thesis I on the Gallatin website for a 
suggested meeting schedule. Students should also make note of the location and times for the required 
workshops (see the course description for more details). 
</p>
   <p>
Master’s Thesis I is graded pass/fail. At the end of the semester, Gallatin will ask you to submit a grade 
for this student. To pass this course, students must attend the required workshops, fulfill the 
presentation requirement, and demonstrate significant progress toward completing the thesis. 
</p>
   <p>
Please note that you will receive compensation for a two-credit independent study for supervising the 
student’s work in this course. 
</p>
<h1>Thesis Proposal Submission and Approval</h1>
   <p>
Students who begin Master’s Thesis I without an approved thesis proposal should plan to submit the proposal 
to Gallatin using the online <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/utilities/forms/thesis-proposal.html">Thesis Proposal Submission form</a> within the first few weeks of the 
semester. Note that students who complete Thesis Proposal Seminar in the Spring are required to 
submit the thesis proposal to Gallatin by October 1, and students who complete Thesis Proposal 
Seminar in the Fall are required to submit the thesis proposal by February 1. If your advisee does not 
yet have an approved proposal, please encourage him/her to submit the proposal as soon as possible. 
If you have questions about Master’s Thesis I, please feel free to contact me or <a href="mailto:kah3@nyu.edu">Karen Hornick</a> and 
<a href="mailto:ritty.lukose@nyu.edu">Ritty Lukose</a>, the faculty co-directors of the M.A. program. Thank you for overseeing your 
advisee’s work in this course. We appreciate your support of the Gallatin M.A. program.

   <p>
Sincerely, <br/>
