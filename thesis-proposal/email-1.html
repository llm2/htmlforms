<strong>Dear %value[first_name] %value[last_name]</strong>,<br/>

Your thesis proposal has been received. Gallatin will contact your adviser
to confirm his or her approval of the proposal.  After we receive your adviser's approval, we will assign the proposal to a Gallatin reviewer.  When the Gallatin faculty member has reviewed your proposal, you will receive an email with the results of the review.

Please allow at least two to three weeks for review of your proposal during the fall and spring semesters, and five to six weeks during the summer terms.  For more information about the Gallatin thesis process, please see the
