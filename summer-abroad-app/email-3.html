<strong>Dear %value[adviser]</strong>,<br/>

Your advisee, %value[first_name] %value[last_name], has submitted an application for a Gallatin travel course for the %value[application_type] term, copied below for your reference. This application requires a response from you. If your advisee has not discussed this application with you, you may request that s/he meet with you before deciding whether or not you approve of this plan.
</p>
<p>
Once you have made a determination, please reply to this email to inform Gallatin’s Office of Global Programs about your decision. You may also want to let your advisee know your decision and your rationale for it. If you have concerns about your advisee’s ability to succeed in this course or program, feel free to contact me directly at <a href="mailto:kim.foote@nyu.edu">kim.foote@nyu.edu</a> or if you prefer, call me at 212-992-6311. 
</p>
<p>
Please note that if you approve this plan, your advisee will not need to complete a separate Plan of Study for this course or program, nor will you be required to submit a separate approval. The Office of Global Programs will facilitate clearing your advisee to register for the course or program, and we will review your advisee’s degree progress report to ensure s/he is in compliance with Gallatin’s residency requirement, etc.
</p>
<p>
Also note that your approval would be for your advisee’s travel course only. If your advisee changes his/her mind and wishes to take courses at NYU instead, our expectation is that s/he will obtain approval from you via the Plan of Study.
</p>
<p>
Finally, please understand that your approval of this plan does not guarantee your advisee a space in the course or program. Acceptance is based on a variety of factors, which may be found on the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/global.html">Global Programs web page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
If you have any general questions about your advisee’s application, please contact our office at <a href="mailto:gallatin.global@nyu.edu">gallatin.global@nyu.edu</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Kim Foote, Assistant Director<br/>
Office of Global Programs
