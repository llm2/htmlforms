<p><strong>Dear [submission:values:instructor_first_name] [submission:values:instructor_last_name]</strong>,</p>

<p>Below is a Gallatin Tutorial proposal that has been submitted by [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name], who listed you as their professor for this study, and which requires your approval before it will be reviewed by Gallatin’s Committee on Individualized Studies. Each member of your tutorial must complete an individual proposal form. You may therefore receive up to five of these proposal emails to approve.  All of the proposals should contain the same number of credits/units, the same description of the study, syllabus, reading list and work to be submitted for evaluation. 
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that the Committee on Individualized Studies will not be able to review any tutorial proposals until at least two of your students have submitted completed proposal forms and these proposals have been approved by you and the student’s adviser.
</p><p>
All students were instructed to speak with you in advance of submitting this form, and well in advance of the proposal submission deadline.  If this particular student has not discussed this proposal with you, you may reject it, and request that he or she meets with you before you approve it.
Approval Process:
<ul>
<li>Once you are ready to approve this proposal, please reply to this email to submit your approval.</li>
<li>Students were informed to submit this proposal to you with enough advance notice for you to be able to approve this by the following deadline:
