<strong>Dear [submission:values:first_name] [submission:values:last_name]</strong>,
</p>
<p>
This is to confirm that your Independent Study proposal form is being forwarded to your adviser and grading instructor (to the emails you listed on the proposal form) for review and approval. If you did not discuss this project with them prior to submitting this form, your proposal may not be approved by one or both of them. Because you must take additional action before your independent study proposal can be approved, please read this entire message to make sure your proposal is not denied.
</p>
<p>
Your completed proposal, which includes all of the following, is due at Gallatin by the <a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/calendars/individualized_project_deadlines.html">published proposal submission deadline</a>:  
<ul><li>adviser’s approval</li>
<li>instructor’s approval</li>
<li>description of the study</li>
<li>syllabus</li>
<li>booklist</li></ul>
Proposals missing any of the required items listed above by the deadline will not be considered for review for this semester.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Take these next steps</h2>
<ol><li> <em>Follow up with your adviser and instructor before the proposal submission deadline</em> to make sure they have received your proposal form and have sent their approval to Gallatin.</li>
<li>  <em>Be informed about the review process.</em> Your submitted proposal form has also been sent to Gallatin.  We will review the form now to make sure the description, syllabus and booklist are included.  We will also be receiving your adviser’s and instructor’s approval.  When all elements of the full proposal are received, the Gallatin Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies will review the proposal, provided everything is received by the submission deadline.</li>
<li> <em>Watch for an email from Gallatin.</em>  You might be asked to provide additional materials, or you might be receiving an approval email with codes to register on Albert.  The Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies plans to review and respond to all students approximately two weeks after the submission deadline.  Proposals submitted prior to the deadline may be reviewed sooner.</li>
<li> If your proposal is approved and you receive registration codes, log on to Albert to register for your independent study. </li>
<li>  Be prepared to take an alternate course in case your proposal is not approved.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about this process, please contact KatheAnn Joseph (<a href="mailto:katheann.joseph@nyu.edu">katheann.joseph@nyu.edu</a>) at Gallatin.

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies
